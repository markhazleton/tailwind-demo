- **Better Debugging**: CSS-first approach more intuitive for developers
- **Maintainability**: Cleaner, more focused configuration files

## Technical Implementation Details

### 1. Configuration Migration Strategy

#### From JavaScript to CSS-First
```css
/* Before: JavaScript configuration */
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    colors: { primary: { 600: '#0284c7' } }
  }
}

/* After: CSS-first with @theme directive */
@theme {
  --color-primary-600: #0284c7;
}
```

#### Build System Transformation
```typescript
// Before: PostCSS plugin
plugins: [require('tailwindcss')]

// After: Native Vite integration
plugins: [tailwindcss()]
```

### 2. Critical Problem Resolution

#### Status Color Utilities Issue
**Problem**: TailwindCSS v4 @theme directive wasn't auto-generating status color utilities (bg-success-600, bg-warning-600, bg-error-600).

**Root Cause**: Automatic utility generation from @theme directive had gaps for certain color utility patterns.

**Solution**: Explicit @layer utilities approach
```css
@layer utilities {
  .bg-success-600 { background-color: var(--color-success-600); }
  .hover\:bg-success-700:hover { background-color: var(--color-success-700); }
  .focus\:ring-success-500:focus { --tw-ring-color: var(--color-success-500); }
  /* ... similar for warning and error */
}
```

**Result**: 100% reliable utility class generation without content scanning issues.

### 3. Architecture Improvements

#### Monorepo Structure Optimization
- **Design Tokens Package**: Centralized theme definition with CSS variables
- **UI Components Package**: Leveraging semantic tokens for consistency
- **Demo App**: Showcasing all design system capabilities

#### Dependency Management
- **Removed**: @tailwindcss/typography, @tailwindcss/forms, @tailwindcss/aspect-ratio, autoprefixer
- **Added**: @tailwindcss/vite for seamless integration
- **Result**: Cleaner dependency tree with better performance
