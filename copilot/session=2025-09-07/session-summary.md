# Session Summary - September 7, 2025

## Objective

Update the GitHub Copilot instructions to include guidelines for organizing agent-generated documents in a structured `/copilot/` directory.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Copilot Instructions

- Added new section "Agent-Generated Documentation" to `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- Established guidelines for placing all agent-generated documents in `/copilot/session={YYYY-MM-DD}/` folders
- Defined organization structure with subdirectories for different document types:
  - `plans/` - Architectural and implementation plans
  - `analysis/` - Code analysis and audit reports
  - `documentation/` - Generated technical documentation
  - `specifications/` - Feature and API specifications

### 2. Created Directory Structure

- Created `/copilot/` root directory
- Created initial session folder `/copilot/session=2025-09-07/` with all subdirectories
- Added comprehensive README.md explaining the organization system

### 3. Documentation Standards

- Established naming conventions for session folders using YYYY-MM-DD format
- Required session summary files for each session
- Added guidelines for descriptive filenames with timestamps
- Emphasized the importance of moving existing agent-generated documents to the new structure

## Benefits

- Clear separation of AI-generated content from manual code
- Historical tracking of development decisions and AI assistance
- Improved project organization and maintainability
- Easy reference for future development work

## Next Steps

- Future agent-generated documents should follow this new structure
- Consider moving any existing agent-generated documents to appropriate `/copilot/` locations
- Maintain session summaries for ongoing development work
