# Copilot Generated Documents

This directory contains all documents generated by GitHub Copilot during development sessions. Documents are organized by session date to maintain a clear history of AI-assisted development work.

## Directory Structure

```text
copilot/
├── README.md (this file)
└── session=YYYY-MM-DD/
    ├── session-summary.md
    ├── plans/
    │   └── [implementation and architectural plans]
    ├── analysis/
    │   └── [code analysis and audit reports]
    ├── documentation/
    │   └── [technical documentation]
    └── specifications/
        └── [feature and API specifications]
```

## Organization Guidelines

- **Session Folders**: Use the format `session={YYYY-MM-DD}` for each development session
- **Categorization**: Organize documents by type within each session folder
- **Naming**: Use descriptive filenames with timestamps for multiple documents of the same type
- **Summary**: Include a `session-summary.md` file in each session folder to provide context

## Purpose

This structure helps maintain:

- Clear separation of AI-generated content from manual code
- Historical tracking of development decisions and processes
- Easy reference for future development work
- Documentation of the AI-assisted development workflow

## Usage

All agent-generated documents should be placed in the appropriate session folder. This includes:

- Implementation plans and architectural designs
- Code analysis reports and recommendations
- Technical documentation and guides
- Feature specifications and API designs
